This messy python script allows you to create "Stellaris x{number}" mode almost automatically.
In order for it to work, you have to make sure that you've downloaded and installed Python, and that you have Stellaris installed on your hard drive.
To run this script, open CMD or terminal, navigate to folder where you cloned this repository, and type
'python ./x10.py'
Mod files will be generated in ./mod directory.
You can configure this script by modifying the 'config.json' file.
If you want to add any new modifiers, just add them to "modifiers.txt" file. Instructions on how this works are inside the file.

That's all I think...

Have fun decimating Stellaris balance as much as you want!

Limitations:

some effects are handled in on_actions which cant be edited only called, this can potentially bypassed by making a file to call them repeatedly but im not sure how well that will work

other effects are handled in the buildings and pop_jobs and i don't want to change the base numbers of the buildings and jobs in those files so this generator wont work for these effects

Opinion modifiers are unchanged for the same reason as above (opinion_modifiers if you want to change it manually)

effects are sometimes just hard coded and cant be changed (looking at you relics)

i cant find where some modifiers are stored so they are currently unchanged

event modifiers probably aren't changed unless they reference one of the things that are changed


here is a link to a non-comprehensive, messy sheet that has some of the modifiers that probably aren't changed

TLDR: Most effects that add an extra effect to buildings or jobs (example: Agrarian Idyll with +2 Amenities per 100 Farmers and Improved Production with +10% Resources/Upkeep from Jobs from tier 2 capitals),  most relic activation effects, most agenda activation effects, opinion modifiers, and some effects in general just don't work

Note: some effects like Additional Leader Trait Options may require you to lower your UI scaling in the graphics settings to see all the possible options 
if used without UI Overhaul Dynamic the maximum civic options available to choose can be limited
